“And death shall have no dominion.\
Dead men naked they shall be one\
With the man in the wind and the west moon;\   
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,\
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;\
Though they go mad they shall be sane,\ 
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;\
Though lovers be lost love shall not;\  
And death shall have no dominion.”
