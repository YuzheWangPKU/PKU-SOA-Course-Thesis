“And death shall have no dominion.<br/>  
Dead men naked they shall be one<br/>   
With the man in the wind and the west moon;<br/>   
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,<br/>   
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;<br/>   
Though they go mad they shall be sane,<br/>   
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;<br/>   
Though lovers be lost love shall not;<br/>   
And death shall have no dominion.”
